    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

  <ol>

    <li>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, chopped onion, bread crumbs, egg, and milk. Season with parsley, Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Mix well with your hands. Shape into walnut-size balls, and place on baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes in preheated oven. Turn frequently so they brown evenly on all sides.</li>
    <li>To make the sauce: In a saucepan, combine oil, flour, paprika, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Cook over medium heat until sizzling. Stir in hot water and sour cream until smooth and heated through.</li>
    <li>When meatballs have cooked 30 minutes, pour sauce over the top, and return to the oven for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
